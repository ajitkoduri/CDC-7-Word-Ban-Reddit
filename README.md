CDC 7 Word Ban for Reddit.py is a file that looks over the original Reddit post in R/politics about the CDC word ban. In there, I look at the general sentiment of the posts versus the popularity of the opinion, explore the word usage in the comments with both frequency distribution and sentiment analysis. I also look at the subreddits the users that posted on the thread frequent, and analyzed which subreddits were the most popularly voted and which were the least. Following that, I make a word cloud from the cumulative comments and a frequency distribution of words used.

Python libraries required: praw, pandas, numpy, nltk, textblob, matplotlib, time, and wordcloud
